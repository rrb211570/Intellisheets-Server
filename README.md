# Intellisheets Server

- Integrates with MongoDB and SendGrid (ESP for sending emails). Hosted on Heroku.
- Implements user auth protocol from scratch, returns page redirection flags, and processes create/save/load for spreadsheets.

(Additionally, see sibling repo called 'Intellisheets-Client'; most of the project-work is client-side).
