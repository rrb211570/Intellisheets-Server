# Intellisheets Server

(See sibling repo called 'Intellisheets-Client' for more details; most of the project-work is client-side).

- Integrates with MongoDB and SendGrid (ESP for sending emails). Hosted on Heroku.
- Implements user auth protocol from scratch, returns page redirection flags, and processes create/save/load for spreadsheets.
